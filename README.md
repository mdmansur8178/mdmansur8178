- 👋 Assalamu Alaikum. Hi! This is Mansurul Hoque.
- ❤️ I'm a hafiz Quran and right now I'm studying at Qawmi Madrasah to be a graduate person in Islamic studies.
- 👀 I’m interested in Web programming, Islamic nasheed singing, and Sound designing.
- 🌱 Currently I’m learning web design and development. First I started this mission using my handphone. Now I have a laptop which my brother bought me.
Keep me and him in your blessing.
